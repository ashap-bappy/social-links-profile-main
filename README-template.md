## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to work with this project without a figma file. I had to trust my instinct. I also learned uses of display: block because when I styled the li elements it was not clickable, then I had to search and make it clickable. I also used css custom properties and learned about root elements and before and after psuedo elements.

```css
.links ul li a {
  display: block;
  padding: 1.2rem 7.8rem;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: var(--clr-white);
  font-size: 1.2rem;
  font-weight: var(--fw-bold);
}
```

### Continued development

In the future projects I want to be able to continue development like this and want to explore new css properties.
